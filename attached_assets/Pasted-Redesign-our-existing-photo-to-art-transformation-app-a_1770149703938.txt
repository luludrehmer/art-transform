Redesign our existing photo-to-art transformation app at ai.art-and-see.com/tools/dashboard

## CONTEXT:
- This app receives traffic from our SEO toolhub pages
- Current problem: We ask for sign-in and show "3 free credits" BEFORE users see any value
- Goal: Fable-style conversion flow (fable.surrealium.world) - show value FIRST, monetize AFTER emotional investment
- Our competitive advantage: We can upsell to REAL hand-painted portraits ($149+), competitors can't

## CURRENT FLOW (broken):
Sign in → Credits → Explanation → Upload → Result

## NEW FLOW (convert this to):

### Screen 1: Upload (zero friction)
- Headline: "Transform Your Photo Into Art"
- Large drag-and-drop upload zone
- Horizontal style selector: Oil Painting, Watercolor, Acrylic, Pastel, Charcoal, Pencil Sketch (default: Oil)
- NO sign-in gate
- NO credits mention
- NO "how it works" sections
- Small text below: "Free preview • No signup required"

### Screen 2: Processing
- Show uploaded image with loading animation
- Text: "Creating your masterpiece..."
- Minimum 3-second delay to build anticipation

### Screen 3: Preview + Monetization (this is where conversion happens)
- Display transformed image WITH subtle watermark
- Clear pricing tiers below:

  FREE: Watermarked download [Download button - no sign-in needed]
  
  HD NO WATERMARK: $19 [Sign in to purchase]
  
  MUSEUM-QUALITY PRINT: $79 [Sign in to purchase]
  - Archival paper, fade-resistant inks
  - Free shipping
  
- Separator line, then upsell block:
  
  "✨ Want a REAL Hand-Painted Masterpiece?"
  "Our master artists create museum-quality oil paintings from your photo"
  "From $149 • 7-10 day delivery • Worldwide shipping"
  [Explore Hand-Painted Options →] (links to portraits.art-and-see.com)

### Screen 4: Try Another Style
- After download, prompt: "Try another style?" with style pills
- Keep them in the loop, increase engagement

## DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Clean, premium, minimal (like Fable)
- Dark or light theme that feels gallery/art-world
- Mobile-first
- Trust badges and social proof ONLY on pricing screen, not before

## TECH NOTES:
- Preserve existing AI transformation backend/API
- Sign-in only triggered for paid options
- Track: uploads, style selections, download clicks, upsell clicks (for analytics)

## BRAND:
- Part of Art & See (art-and-see.com)
- Premium positioning - we sell real paintings, this tool is the top of funnel
