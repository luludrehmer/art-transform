          <h2>Digital Downloads</h2>
          <p>
            Due to the nature of digital products, we generally do not offer refunds for digital 
            downloads. However, if you're unhappy with your transformation, contact us and we'll 
            work with you to create a new version at no extra cost.

          <h2>Handmade Products</h2>
          <p>
            Our hand-painted oil paintings are made-to-order by professional artists and are 
            therefore not eligible for a standard refund. However, if you're unhappy with your 
            painting, please contact us — we want to make it right. All shipments are fully 
            insured, and we will:
          </p>

            <li>Replace any painting that arrives damaged at no cost to you</li>
            <li>Provide a full refund for items damaged in transit</li>
            <li>Work with you on revisions if the painting doesn't meet your expectations</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Printed Products</h2>
          <p>
            If your printed product arrives damaged or doesn't meet your expectations, please 
            contact us within 30 days of delivery. We'll either:
          </p>

            <li>Send you a replacement at no additional cost</li>
            <li>Provide a full refund</li>
